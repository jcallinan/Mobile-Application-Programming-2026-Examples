# Homework Solution

This solution mirrors the homework requirements:

- Tasks live in state.
- TaskCard is presentational and raises events.
- Board owns update functions and passes callback props.

Files:

- `Board.jsx`: state owner with map/filter updates.
- `TaskCard.jsx`: presentational component with buttons.
